   <h3>ERITREA</h3>
    <p>Eritrea, country of the Horn of Africa, located on the Red Sea.
         Eritrea’s coastal location has long been important in its his
         tory and culture—a fact reflected in its name, which is an
         Italianized version of Mare Erythraeum, Latin for “Red Sea.”
          The Red Sea was the route by which Christianity and Islam 
          reached the area, and it was an important trade route that 
          such powers as Turkey, Egypt, and Italy hoped to dominate by 
          seizing control of ports on the Eritrean coast. Those ports
           promised access to the gold, coffee, and slaves sold by
            traders in the Ethiopian highlands to the south, and, in the
             second half of the 20th century, Ethiopia became the power
              from which the Eritrean people had to free themselves in
               order to create their own state.
